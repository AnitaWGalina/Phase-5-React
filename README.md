## DESCRIPTION.
Far too often, farmers in rural areas face numerous difficulties when it comes to advertising and selling their produce to make a profit. Examples include:
1. Inadequate access to tools and products that will help improve the quality of their farms.
2. A lack of competent marketing schemes that empower the farmers by selling their goods to ready consumers.
3. Outdated or dangerous farming practices that lead to the deterioration of the farms which consequently lowers the agricultural yield.

Thus we thought it would be a judicious decision to come up with a  management system   that seeks to ameliorate the day-to-day lives of farmers by empowering them through efficient and effective micro-groups. This will be implemented by providing  them with a melange of services in addition to selling their products to both local and international markets through our platform, all in an effort to bridge the gap between farmers and the agricultural market. Ultimately increasing their yield.
